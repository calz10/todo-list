1. State Management:

I use redux-toolkit state management, as its commonly use in large and complex application. We can access state and store globally and by using slices
we can optimize performance by creating selectors and its more organized.

2. Performance Optimization:
I have created selectors and tried to put logic inside of those selectors as well so we can reduce code in component and seperate logic as possible
this selectors also will prevent unnecessary rerendering.

4. Code Structure

As of now its the initial setup of expo, it has folders for each like hooks, pure components, screen itself which more organized and easy to maintain.

Also the structure will help new developers to understand how it works.
